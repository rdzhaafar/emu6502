A WDC6502 microprocessor emulator and debugger written in Go.

## Features

- Complete implementation of the WDC6502 ISA
- Can be used as a library or as a comprehensive emulator
- Contains a debugger

## Limitations

This library **does not** emulate all of the electronic behaviour of the WDC6502. Notably, there is no clock-accurate emulation.

## Requirements
